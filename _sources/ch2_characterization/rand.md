# Randomness

[Measure theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)) studies things that are measurable (e.g. length, area, volume) but generalized to various dimensions. The _measure_ tells us how things are distributed and concentrated in a mathematical space.

::::{admonition} Example: The Sphere
Any point on the sphere can be specified by three parameters: e.g. (x,y,z) in Cartesian coordinates or $(\rho, \theta, \phi)$ in spherical coordinates.

Suppose we wish to find the volume. The first thought may be to integrate each parameter over its full range:

$$
V = \int_0^{r} \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{\pi} d\rho~ d\phi~ d\theta = 2\pi^2 r
$$

But this is clearly wrong (the volume of a sphere with radius $r$ is $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.) Taking the integral in this way does not account for the _structure_ of the sphere with respect to the parameters. If you have ever studied multivariate calculus this may sound familiar.

:align: center
```

The issue is that although the difference $d\theta$ and $d\phi$ are the same, there is more _stuff_ near the equator of the sphere. Therefore the integral must account for the value of $\theta$. Similarly, as we are closer to the center of the sphere there is less _stuff_ compared to as we go further away from the center. Hence we must also include the radius $\rho$ as part of the integral. 

So the correct integral is:

$$
V = \int_0^r \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{\pi} \rho^2 \sin \theta~ d\rho~ d\phi~
d\theta = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3
$$

The extra terms $\rho^2\sin\theta$ is the _measure_. The measure weight portions of the sphere differently depending on where they are in the sphere.

::::

Although the _measure_ tells us how to properly integrate, is also tells us another important fact: _how to sample points in the spae uniformly as random_. We cannot simply take each parameter and sample it from the uniform distribution -- this does not take into account the spread of the space. The measure tells us the distribution of each parameters and let us obtain something truly uniform.

## Haar Measure

Quantum evolutions (and operations in quantum computing) are described by unitary matrices. Just like the sphere, unitary matrices can be expressed in terms of a fixed set of parameters. For example, a qubit operation can be written as:

$$
\begin{align}
U(\alpha, \theta, v_x, v_y, v_z) = e^{i\alpha} \exp(-i \theta/2 \vec{v} \cdot \vec{\sigma}) &= \exp[-i \theta/2 (v_x \sigma_x + v_y \sigma_y + v_z \sigma_z)] \\
&= \cos(\theta/2) I - i \sin(\theta/2) (v_x \sigma_x + v_y \sigma_y + v_z \sigma_z)
\end{align}
$$

where $v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2 = 1$. We ignore $e^{i\alpha}$ because it is a global phase. So we are left with four parameters. But because we have the constraint that $v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2 = 1$, we only need a total of **3 parameters** to describe a single qubit operation.

In fact we can write any unitary matrix (ignoring global phase) of size $N \times N$ as:

$$
U(\vec{l}) = \exp(-i \vec{l} \cdot \vec{\Lambda})
$$

where $\vec{\Lambda}$ contains $N^2 -1$ _traceless Hermitian_ operators that define space, similar to the Pauli matrices for the case $N=2$. 


For a dimension $N$, the unitary matrix of size $N \times N$ form the unitary group $U(N)$. 

```{note}
Because we ignored the global phase, the operations we provided are technically $SU(N)$ the _special_ unitary group, where $det(U) = 1$. 
```

Just like the points of the sphere, we can perform operations on the unitary group: such as integration, functions, and sample uniformly. But just like the sphere, we have to add the _measure_ in order to properly account for the different weights in different regions of the space. This is known as the _Haar measure_, is often denoted as $\mu_N$.

$\mu_N$ tells us how to weight the elements of $U(N)$. So for example, if we have some function $f$ acting on the elements of $U(N)$ and we would like to integrate over this group, we would have:

$$
\int_{V \in U(N)} f(V) d\mu_N(V).
$$

### Example: qubit

Let us consider the following task: _generate a random qubit state_. To do this let us generate a Haar-random unitary and then apply it an initial state (e.g. $\ket{0}$). 

First let us do this incorrectly. To make things easier, let us use the following representation of a single-qubit gate:

$$
U(\theta, \phi, \lambda) = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) & -e^{i\lambda} \sin(\theta/2) \\
e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta/2) & e^{i\lambda + i \phi} \cos(\theta/2)
\end{bmatrix}
$$

import qutip as qp

```


```{code-cell} ipython3
def bad_random_qubit_unitary():
    phi, theta, lam = 2 * np.pi * np.random.uniform(size=3)
    U = np.array([
            [np.cos(theta/2), -np.exp(-1j * lam) * np.sin(theta/2)],
            [np.exp(1j * phi) * np.sin(theta/2), np.exp(1j * (phi + lam) * np.cos(theta/2))]
        ])
    return U

samples = 1000

bad_random_unitaries = [bad_random_qubit_unitary() for _ in range(samples)]
bad_random_states = [U[:,0] for U in bad_random_unitaries]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

states = [qp.Qobj(s) for s in bad_random_states]
b = qp.Bloch()
b.point_color = ['#ff0000']
b.point_marker = ['o']
b.add_states(states, kind='point')
b.show()
```

Note that although we uniformly sampled our parameters, the output states cluster around the poles of the sphere. Now let us properly sample from the proper Haar measure.

Unlike the regular sphere, our sphere has a fixed radius of 1, so we need not worry about this parameter. However, similar to the regular sphere, we need to worry about $\theta$. Since the adjustment is identical to the regular sphere, we can use $\sin\theta$. Hence, in order to uniformly sample $\theta$ we need to use the distribution $\mathrm{Pr}(\theta) = \sin \theta$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from scipy.stats import rv_continuous

class sin_theta_dist(rv_continuous):
    def _pdf(self, theta):
        return 0.5 * np.sin(theta)

sin_theta_sampler = sin_theta_dist(a=0, b=np.pi)

def haar_random_qubit_unitary():
    phi, lam = 2 * np.pi * np.random.uniform(size=2)
    theta = sin_theta_sampler.rvs(size=1)
    U = np.array([
        [np.cos(theta/2), -np.exp(-1j * lam) * np.sin(theta/2)],
        [np.exp(1j * phi) * np.sin(theta/2), np.exp(1j * (phi + lam) * np.cos(theta/2))]
    ])
    return U

haar_random_unitaries = [haar_random_qubit_unitary() for _ in range(samples)]
haar_random_states = [U[:,0] for U in haar_random_unitaries]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

states = [qp.Qobj(s) for s in haar_random_states]
b = qp.Bloch()
b.point_color = ['#ff0000']
b.point_marker = ['o']
b.add_states(states, kind='point')
b.show()
```

As we can see, by using the correct measure, our qubit states are now uniformly distributed over the sphere. Explicitly, our Haar measure is:

$$
d\mu_2 = \sin \theta d\theta \cdot d\phi \cdot d\lambda.
$$

### Example: arbitrary dimension

Following [arXiv:math-ph/0609050](https://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0609050), we can use the QR decomposition of a complex-valued matrix to generate Haar-random unitary matrices. This actually implemented in [scipy.stats.unitary_group](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.unitary_group.html).

```{code-cell} ipython3
def haar_random_unitary(N, fixed=True):
    R, I = np.random.normal(size=(N,N)), np.random.normal(size=(N,N))
    Z = R + 1j * I

    Q, R = np.linalg.qr(Z)

    if fixed:
        L = np.diag([R[i, i] / np.abs(R[i, i]) for i in range(N)])
        Q = Q @ L
    
    return Q

N = 10
rand = [haar_random_unitary(N) for _ in range(samples)]
rand_not_fixed = [haar_random_unitary(N, fixed=False) for _ in range(samples)]
```

As explained in [arXiv:math-ph/0609050](https://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0609050), the solution to the QR decomposition is not unique. We can take any unitary diagonal matrix $\Lambda$, and alter the decomposition as $QR = Q \Lambda \Lambda^\dagger R = Q^\prime R^\prime$. To insure the unitary matrices are indeed Haar-random, we need to fix a particular $\Lambda$ which depends on $R$. 

Another fact is that the eigenvalues of a Haar-random unitary matrices should be uniform. And the eigenvalues of a unitary matrix are given as $e^{i\theta}$. Let us check if using the QR-decomposition method if our $\theta$ eigenvalues are uniform!

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]
eigs_rand = np.array([np.linalg.eigvals(r) for r in rand_not_fixed]).flatten()

hist = plt.hist(np.angle(eigs_rand), 50, density=True)
plt.ylabel("Eigenvalue Density")
plt.title(r"QR decomposition with $\Lambda$ not fixed")
plt.show()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]
eigs_rand = np.array([np.linalg.eigvals(r) for r in rand]).flatten()

hist = plt.hist(np.angle(eigs_rand), 50, density=True)
plt.ylabel("Eigenvalue Density")
plt.title(r"QR decomposition with $\Lambda$ fixed")
plt.show()
```

We have successfully generated Haar-random unitary matrices as shown by the uniform distribution of their eigenvalues.

## Integrating Unitary Operators

Often in quantum computing we will find ourselves needing to perform an integral over quantum objects, such as unitary operators or quantum states.

For example, our quantum computer performed a quantum operator $\mathcal{E}$ and we wish to find how _close_ it was to our desired unitary operation $U$. Well this require integrating over a uniform (Haar-random) space!

$$
F(\mathcal{E}, U) = \int \bra{\psi}U^\dagger \mathcal{E} U \ket{\psi}
$$
