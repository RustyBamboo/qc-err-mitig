# Introduction

Now that we are able to identify the characteristics of noise in our quantum computers, we would like some ways to _mitigate_ (at best _eliminate_) this noise.

We will work our way from the low-level strategies to the high-level strategies.

1. Device-Hamiltonian characterization
2. Pulse optimization
3. Noise-resilient quantum algorithms
4. Noise cancellation
