```{admonition} About the logo
Generated using [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion), the logo represents the narrative that a quantum system is part of an environment. The bottle represents two conflicting ideas: (1) the attempt to isolate an intricate quantum system from its enivornment (e.g. a quantum computer),  but also (2) the intentional ability for the environment to control the interior system -- as represented by the lid.
